# Final Nights

- Player is a "guy"
- Setting: A playplace
- Enemy: An animatronic dog
- Goal: Find 5 kids' toys per night with notes about them and how it was their favorite toy. Kid soul whisper sound plays on collecting.
  - Plushie, ball, toy car
  - Get caught -> buries you in ball pit
    - Win -> camera races to animatronic who falls to knees, cries black tears, kid's soul released
  - On collecting, animatronic gets better:
    - Mechanism: Patrols and chases on sight; falls after certain amount of time chasing; can distract with sounds (player has rock they can throw?); player must break LoS to stop chase?
    - First toy: Slow movement, frequent presence-noises
    - Second toy: Faster non-chase and chase movement, less frequent presence-noises, longer chase duration
    - Third toy: Same increases;
    - Fourth toy: Constant but slower chasing, constant screaming/howling
